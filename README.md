# Will's Nerds

Will's Nerds is a simple project by [Will](https://withoutwax.me). It is an archive / collection of his friends' profile when Will met during 2016~2019. Will realized that he made a lot of great and amazing friends (in / outside his school) and since they were so great he wanted to make something special that is memorable for all.   
The name 'Will's Nerds' was born after two of his friends: Jung and [Chris](https://www.chriszhu-design.com/) (Kristoff Liebermann). Jung is a designer and a automotive lover. She loves car so much, to the point where you cannot imagine. Will even thought that even when she doesn't get married to a human being, she will get married to the car. Chris (Kristoff Liebermann) is mixture of everything: Australian + Singaporean + America + Canada + Birds. Oh yes, he loves birds. Also one thing to remember is that he loves Obama so much, which was the actual reason coming to this school. He's the only one who was able to shook hands with Obama. He loves Obama. Will is definitely glad that he met this guy.
